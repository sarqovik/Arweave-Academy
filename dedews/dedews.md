### Introduce Yourself
For now, I have a small project called HyukaNode, where I work on network security in blockchain, such as validating and managing network nodes, or more commonly known as node network management and validator security. The project I am currently participating in is Redbelly Network, which operates on its own Layer 1 (L1) network.

My contribution to the Arweave/AO network: Currently, I am contributing to the network by staking ETH, DAI, and AR, as well as participating in other ecosystems. Specifically, within the AO network ecosystem, I contribute by promoting it on social media and introducing AO to everyone
