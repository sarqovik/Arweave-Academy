### Frontend Challenge 1: File-based Routing

- **Decription**  
A simple portfolio website with multiple HTML files that link to Github and other source then deploy it on Arweave.
- **Why?**  
This is the easiest way to build a website and fits Arweave’s permanent storage model, and AR.IO gateways can’t execute server-side code. Use it for very simple websites when additional tooling would create too much overhead.
