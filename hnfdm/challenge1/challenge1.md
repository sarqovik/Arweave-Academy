### Frontend Challenge 1: File-based Routing

- **Decription**  
A simple portfolio website with multiple HTML files that link to Github and other source then deploy it on Arweave.
- **Why?**  
This is the easiest way to build a website and fits Arweave’s permanent storage model, and AR.IO gateways can’t execute server-side code. Use it for very simple websites when additional tooling would create too much overhead. For instance, a single landing page portfolio website built with React is an ideal use case. React provides a simple yet powerful way to build interactive components, while the lightweight nature of single-page applications (SPAs) aligns perfectly with Arweave’s decentralized, permanent storage. By leveraging React, developers can create visually engaging portfolios with minimal effort, and deploying it via Arweave ensures it remains immutable and permanently accessible.
- **Tools**  
React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and SCSS, Emotion, Font Awesome, MUI & Arlink, etc.
- **Live**
