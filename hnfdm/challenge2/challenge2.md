### Frontend Challenge 2: Static Site Generation

- **Decription**  
A simple Airdrop ASC website and deploy it to Arweave.
- **Why?**  
Because it fits Arweave’s permanent storage model, and AR.IO gateways can’t execute server-side code. Use SSG for content-heavy websites that don’t change often. For example, a simple identity website built with Vue.js is an excellent choice. Vue.js, paired with a static site generator like Nuxt.js, enables developers to quickly build lightweight, responsive websites. These sites can showcase essential identity or branding information (like personal or business profiles) while taking full advantage of Arweave’s immutable and decentralized storage to ensure long-term accessibility and integrity.
- **Tools**
